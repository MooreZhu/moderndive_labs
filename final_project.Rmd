Everything in this course builds up to the term group project, where there is
only one learning goal: *Engage in the data/science research pipeline in as
faithful a manner as possible while maintaining a level suitable for novices.*

In a nutshell, the final project is in five-stages. By spreading out the work over the semester, pressure is taken off the end when the final submission is due. In particular, finding data should be done early.

1. Forming groups
1. [Proposing data](static/Final Project/1_data_proposal_example.html){target="_blank"}
1. [Proposing project](static/Final Project/2_project_proposal_example.html){target="_blank"}
1. [Making an initial submission](static/Final Project/3_submission_example.html){target="_blank"}
1. [Making a resubmission](static/Final Project/4_resubmission_example.html){target="_blank"}

More detail on how we presented the project are below.

We would like to thank Smith College students Alexis Cohen, Andrianne Dao, Isabel Gomez for allowing us to use their final project as the template.

# 1. Groups due {#groups}

## Action items

1. Form groups of 2-3 students **where all members can attend the same lab section for the labs where you'll be working on your projects (see schedule)**. You do not need to all be *registered* for the same lab section, merely able to all *attend* the same lab.
1. Pick a group name. A prize will be given to the team with my favorite team name!
1. Designate a group leader who will do a little administrative work.

## Items to submit

**Group leader only**:

1. Create two Slack direct messages (DM):
    * One with all your group members + myself + Jenny: <!--Include your group name and--> Say `r emo::ji("wave")` to Jenny and me. Going forward please ask all project related questions here.
    * One with only your group members: Send all private messages amongst yourselves here.
1. Nothing to submit on Moodle this round.
1. Complete the following [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScbXQEq00avzSfBC2tCN5SFIEw_MZ2poC0dSpkjVjnr1oKJSw/viewform){target="_blank"}.


**Everybody individually**:

Nothing this time.


## Notes

* If you need a group to join, please Slack me.
* All groups members are expected to contribute and you will all be held accountable for your contributions in peer evaluations.

# 2. Data proposal due {#data} 

## Action items

* Read moderndive for background tools/concepts
    + Chapter 2.4.4 (new) on identification vs measurement variables.
    + Chapter 5.1 on importing spreadsheet data into R.
* Read the [example data proposal](static/term_project/data_proposal_example.html){target="_blank"} written by Jenny and Albert.
* Start working on your data proposal
    + Only if you are not working in RStudio Server on the browser, in other words you are working on RStudio Desktop, ensure you have the `janitor` and `readr` packages installed; they are already installed on RStudio Server.
    + Download the following <a href="static/term_project/data_proposal.Rmd" download>`data_proposal.Rmd`</a> template R Markdown file.
    + Move it to your `introstatsR` folder where your work is saved.
    + Knit it!
* **This is likely the most time-consuming portion of the entire project, so start early:** Find a dataset that matches the requirements spelled out in the above `data_proposal.Rmd` template R Markdown file. Possible sources:
    1. Your own data from your own projects!
    1. Consult Spinelli Center Data Counselor Vahab Khademi (see syllabus for contact info).
    1. [Google Dataset Search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch){target="_blank"}
    1. [data.world](https://data.world/){target="_blank"}
    1. [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets){target="_blank"}


## Items to submit

**Group leader only**: On Moodle submit:

1. The `data_proposal.Rmd` R Markdown file
1. The `data_proposal.html` HTML report file
1. Only if you didn't publish your data as a `.csv` on Google Sheets because it has confidential/private information, then include the `.csv` or `.xlsx` spreadsheet file. 


**Everybody individually**:

Nothing this time.


## Notes

* When you have questions:
    + Please ask questions that you think the entire class would like to know the answer to in the `term_project` channel in Slack.
    + Ask more individual questions in the group DM that includes all group members + Jenny + Albert.
* Only minimal data wrangling using the `dplyr` package is expected at this time; you will be doing more for the "project proposal" phase after you're experienced. That being said, feel free to experiment!
* Don't forget to use the tutoring hours: Sun-Thurs 7-9pm in the lecture room.

* For data wrangling tips, check out Jenny and Albert's [Become an R Data Ninja](static/term_project/project_tips.html){target="_blank"} page! You don't need to read all the examples, just read the section headers to see if it addresses your data wrangling needs! You can also download the <a href="static/term_project/project_tips.Rmd" download>`project_tips.Rmd`</a> file.
