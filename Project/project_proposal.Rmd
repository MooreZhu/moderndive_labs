# 1. Load all necessary packages 
```{r}

```

***

# 2. Import and glimpse the data 
```{r message = F}


```

```{r message = F}

```

***

# 3. Clean/wrangle the data 

The steps will be a different for each project, but the basic elements include: 

* Making sure it is in Tidy format
* Selecting only the variables you'll be using in the following order:

a) (If any are included) identification variables
b) The numerical outcome variable y
c) The numerical explanatory variable x1
d) The categorical explanatory variable x2

You may need to transform variables, reclassify, filter, etc. See the R Ninja formatting file for help. 

```{r}

```


```{r}

```


## 3.a. Print a slice of cleaned data 

```{r}

```

## 3.b. Glimpse cleaned data 
Make sure the outcome variable is numeric, one explanatory variable is numeric, and another is either a character <chr> or a factor <fct>. 

```{r}

```

***

# 4. Exploratory analysis 

## 4.a. Inspect for NA values
```{r}

```

## 4.b. Summary statistics outcome variable
```{r fig.cap = "Table 1. Summary statistics of..... ", fig.align = "center"}
            
```

*** 

# 5. Data Visualization 

## 5.a. Histogram- outcome variable 
```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 1. Distribution of...", fig.align = "center"}

```



## 5.b. Scatterplot- outcome variable against numeric variable

```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 2. Scatterplot showing... ", fig.align = "center"}

```


## 5.c. Boxplot- outcome variable by categorical variable

```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 3. Boxplot showing.....", fig.align = "center"}

```


## 5.d. Scatterplot- outcome variable against both predictors

```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 4. Scatterplot illustrating...", fig.align = "center"}

```
