## Collaboration {-}

Please indicate who you collaborated with on this problem set: 


## Background {-}

In this problem set  we will use a small **sample** of data from the [general social survey](http://gss.norc.org/). The survey is designed to monitor changes in both social characteristics and attitudes. You will work with a **sample** from one neighborhood. Here we do **not** know the **true population parameters** for any of the variables, because we do not have data on every person in the neighborhood. 

## Setup

First load the necessary packages 
 

```{r message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(moderndive)
```

Next load the data set, from where it is stored on the web: 

```{r, message = FALSE}
gss_sample <- read_csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSypSoDCMH2N76Vo2dZRPkw2q3t1mbvAXlOtgPDIsHg4NclAQFmER-BdvXH9_lrT40UQCVdPXOi_NMJ/pub?gid=257689625&single=true&output=csv")
```

Be sure to take a look at the data in the **viewer**. Each row in the data set is a person that was surveyed (100 rows or cases in total). The variables in the data set include each respondent's `age`,  `race`, and number of hours of TV watched a day `tvhours`. 

<br> 

<div id="boxedtext">
**Setting a seed:** We will take some random samples and build sampling distributions in this lab. In order to make sure R takes the same random sample every time you run your code, you can do what is called "setting a seed". Do this in any code chunk that you take a random sample! 

You can set a seed like so. Any number will do. (You do not need to run this right now...just showing you how)
```{r}
set.seed(45)
```

# Confidence intervals based on the theoretical normal distribution  

If your data are reasonably normally distributed you can generate a 95% confidence interval using the following formula: 

$$ \widehat{statistic} ± 1.96 * \widehat{SE}$$


So, for instance if we wanted to calculate the 95% Confidence Interval for the mean number of `tvhours` that respondents watched: 

* the **sample statistic** in this case would be the mean number of `tvhours` from the sample: $\bar{x}$

* we would estimate the standard error using the formula: 

$$\widehat{SE} \approx \frac{sd}{\sqrt(n)}$$

We can make these calculations in R like so: 

```{r}
gss_sample %>% 
  summarize(x_bar = mean(tvhours), 
            sd = sd(tvhours), 
            n = n(), 
            se = sd/sqrt(n), 
            lower_ci = x_bar - (1.96 * se), 
            upper_ci = x_bar + (1.96 * se))
```

However, if we plot `tvhours` we can see that it is not perfectly normally distributed. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = gss_sample, aes(x = tvhours)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "aquamarine4", color = "black") + 
                 labs(x = "hours of television per day")
```

If you are concerned that your data do not meet the normality assumptions well enough, you can calculate confidence intervals by generating a bootstrap sampling distribution.

#  Confidence intervals from a bootstrap sample


### Step 1: Take 1000 bootstrap samples

The following code tells R to take 1000 bootstrap samples from the `gss_sample` data. You can set the seed to whatever value you like! 

```{r}
set.seed(42)

boot_samp_1000 <- gss_sample %>% 
  rep_sample_n(size = 100, reps = 1000, replace = TRUE)
```

Note a few important details about the `rep_sample_n` function, and bootstrap sampling in general:

* `size = 100` tells R that each bootstrap sample we take has 100 cases...the size of the original sample

* `reps = 1000` tells R to take 1000 bootstrap samples (each of size 100)

* The `replace = TRUE` argument tells R that in each bootstrap sample, we can include a row from `gss_sample` multiple times. So if for instance, respondent # 12 is the first random sample taken here, respondent 12 is still available to be sampled **again** at random. Thus, some people may appear **multiple times** in our bootstrap sample, and some people from the original data set may not appear at all. 

* we saved the results in `boot_samp_1000`

<br> 

*** 

Take a look at the `boot_samp_1000` we just generated in the data viewer. Note that the `replicate` column labels each bootstrap sample (the first 100 rows are labeled 1, the next 100 rows are labeled 2, etc.)

# Question 1

How many rows does `boot_samp_1000` have? **Why?** 

**Answer: 100,000. Because we took 1000 samples of 100 cases each, which is 100,000 One hundred thousand. **

<br> 

***

### Step 2: Calculate the bootstrap statistic

Let's say we want to use the bootstrap sample that we just generated to calculate a confidence interval for the mean of the variable `tvhours`. To do so, we need to know the mean of `tvhours` **for each of the 1000 bootstrap samples**. In this case, the mean of `tvhours` for **each bootstrap sample** is our **BOOTSTRAP STATISTIC**.  We can calculate that with two lines of code, like so: 

```{r}
boot_distrib_tv <- boot_samp_1000 %>% 
  group_by(replicate) %>% 
  summarize(boot_stat = mean(tvhours))
```

Note that:

-  the `group_by` argument tells R to take the mean of `tvhours`  **separately** for each different `replicate` in the bootstrap sample. 

- we put the mean for each bootstrap sample in a column called `boot_stat`

<br> 

> This is the bootstrap distribution for the mean of `tvhours`! 

<br> 

*** 

Take a look at the `boot_distrib_tv` we just created in the data viewer. 

# Question 2

How many values of the bootstrap statistic (`boot_stat`) are there?  Please explain **why** there are this many values of the bootstrap statistic. 

**Answer: there are 1000 boot_stat values, because we took 1000 bootstrap samples, and calculated the mean for each sample. This equtaes to 1000 bootstrap statsitics**

<br> 

*** 

### Step 3: CI from a bootstrap sample 

### a) CI using the 95% rule 

We can now use the bootstrap distribution for mean `tvhours` to calculate a 95% confidence interval, using the "95% rule", which states that a 95% CI is 

$statistic ± 1.96 \times \widehat{SE}$

* the statistic here would be the mean of the bootstrap distribution 

* the SE can be estimated by the $SD$ of the bootstrap distribution

We can thus apply the 95% rule, like so: 

```{r}
boot_distrib_tv %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(boot_stat), 
            se = sd(boot_stat), 
            lower_ci = mean - (1.96 * se), 
            upper_ci = mean + (1.96 * se))
```



### b) CI using percentile method

You can also calculate a 95% confidence interval using the percentile method.  

The logic goes like this: 

Since our bootstrap sample had 1000 values of `boot_stat` in it, 950 of the `boot_stat` values fall **inside** this 95% confidence interval, 25 values fall **below** it, and 25 values fall **above** it. 

We can use **the quantiles** of the bootstrap distribution to find these values like so:

```{r}
prct_ci_tv <- boot_distrib_tv %>% 
  summarize(lower_ci = quantile(boot_stat, 0.025), 
            upper_ci = quantile(boot_stat, 0.975))

prct_ci_tv
```

This method 

* Asks R to identify the 0.025 quantile of the bootstrap means...this is the value **below** which **2.5% of the values of `boot_stat`** fall (or 25 cases in this example... 25/1000 = 0.025)

* Asks R to identify the 0.975 quantile for the bootstrap means...this is the value **above** which the other **2.5% of the values of `boot_stat`** fall (or 25 cases in this example  975/1000 = 0.975)

* The middle 95% of the values fall between these two quantiles

Based on these results, we are 95% confident that the **true mean hours of TV watched $\mu$ in the population** is between the upper and lower CI we just calculated. 

### Visualizing the Confidence interval 

The bootstrap distribution and the 95% confidence intervals we just calculated are shown in the figure below. This is a histogram of the `boot_stat` values from `boot_distrib_tv`. The green line is the lower bound of the 95% CI, and the blue line is the upper bound. 950 of the 1000 bootstrap samples had a mean for `tvhours` that fell **between** the green and blue lines...25 of the samples had a mean above the blue line, and 25 of the samples had a mean below the green line. 

```{r echo=F, fig.height=3, fig.width=5}
ggplot(data = boot_distrib_tv, aes(x = boot_stat)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 0.25) + 
  labs(title = "Bootstrap distribution with 95% CI", 
       x = "boostrap statistic (mean tvhours)") +
  geom_vline(data = prct_ci_tv, aes(xintercept = lower_ci), color = "green", lwd = 2) + 
    geom_vline(data = prct_ci_tv, aes(xintercept = upper_ci), color = "blue", lwd = 2) 
```

<br>

# Question 3

**If** we calculated a **90% confidence interval** for the mean of `tvhours` using this same bootstrap sample and the percentile method, roughly how many of the 1000 values of `tv_mean` would fall between the green and blue lines?

**Answer: 900**

<br> 

***

# Question 4 

Use the bootstrap sampling distribution for `tvhours` generated above (`boot_distrib_tv`),  and the **percentile** method to calculate a 99% confidence interval for the mean `tvhours`.

```{r}
boot_distrib_tv %>%  
  summarize(lower_ci = quantile(boot_stat, 0.005), 
            upper_ci = quantile(boot_stat, 0.995))

```


<br> 

***

# Question 5

Which confidence interval is **WIDER** the 95% CI for the mean `tvhours` or the 99% confidence interval for the mean `tvhours`? Why?

**Answer: Conceptually, the 99% CI is wider, because we are casting a wider net. Also, more of the boot_stat values are included in a 99% CI (990) as compared to a 95% CI (950)** 


<br> 

***

# Question 6a

Use the bootstrap sample we generated above (`boot_samp_1000`), to generate a **bootstrap distribution** for the mean respondent `age`. 

```{r}
boot_distb_age <- boot_samp_1000 %>% 
  group_by(replicate) %>% 
  summarize(boot_stat = mean(age)) 
```


# Question 6b 

Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the mean respondent `age` using  the **95% rule** method. 


```{r}
boot_distb_age %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(boot_stat), 
            se = sd(boot_stat), 
            upper_ci = mean + (1.96 * se), 
            lower_ci = mean - (1.96 * se))

```


# Question 6c

Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the mean respondent `age` using  the **percentile** method. 

```{r}
boot_distb_age %>% 
  summarize(lower_ci = quantile(boot_stat, 0.025), 
            upper_ci = quantile(boot_stat, 0.975))

```
    
    
# Question 6d

How do the 95% confidence intervals you calculated in 6b and 6c compare? (i.e. are the 95% CI values similar or are they pretty different)


**Answer: they are very similar!** 

<br> 

***

# Question 7

Use the **bootstrap distribution** for the mean respondent `age`, and the percentile method to calculate an 80% confidence interval for the mean respondent age.

```{r}
boot_distb_age %>% 
  summarize(lower_ci = quantile(boot_stat, 0.1), 
            upper_ci = quantile(boot_stat, 0.9))

```

#  Bootstrap sampling distribution & confidence intervals with categorical variables

The procedure for generating a bootstrap sampling distribution is VERY similar for categorical data. As an example we will generate a bootstrap sampling distribution for the proportion of respondents that identified as a Person of Color. 

### Step 1: Take 1000 bootstrap samples

We already did this above! We can use the same `boot_samp_1000` as before. 

### Step2:  Calculate the bootstrap statistic $\hat{p}$

```{r}
boot_distrib_POC <- boot_samp_1000 %>% 
  group_by(replicate) %>% 
  summarize(n = n(), 
            POC_count = sum(race == "POC"), 
            boot_stat = POC_count/n)
```


Note that with a categorical variable, the code differs in two important respects now:  

* the statistic that we calculate with the summarize command is now a **proportion** $\widehat{p}$ rather than a mean

* to get our proportion $\hat{p}$ of **ONE** of the race categories (POC), we need to **first** calculate the total sample size for each replicate, and the count of how many cases are `race == "POC"` in each replicate

### Step 3: Generate the 95% Confidence Interval

### a) CI using the 95% rule 

The following will calculate the 95% confidence interval for the proportion of people that identified as `POC` using the 95% rule. 

```{r}
boot_distrib_POC %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(boot_stat), 
            se = sd(boot_stat), 
            lower_ci = mean - (1.96 * se), 
            upper_ci = mean + (1.96 * se))
```


### b) CI with the percentile method 

The following will calculate the 95% confidence interval for the proportion of people that identified as "POC" using the percentile method. 

```{r}
boot_distrib_POC %>% 
  summarize(lower_ci = quantile(boot_stat, 0.025), 
            upper_ci = quantile(boot_stat, 0.975))

```


# Question 8 

Calculate a 95% CI for the **proportion** of respondents that identified as **White** using EITHER the percentile or 95% rule method. Note that you will first need to generate the bootstrap distribution for the proportion of respondents that identified as `White`. 


```{r}
boot_distrib_wh <- boot_samp_1000 %>% 
  group_by(replicate) %>% 
  summarize(n = n(), 
            wh_count = sum(race == "White"), 
            boot_stat = wh_count/n)
```


```{r}
# 95% rule
boot_distrib_wh %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(boot_stat), 
            se = sd(boot_stat), 
            lower_ci = mean - (1.96 * se), 
            upper_ci = mean + (1.96 * se))
```

```{r}
# percentile
boot_distrib_wh %>% 
  summarize(lower_ci = quantile(boot_stat, 0.025), 
            upper_ci = quantile(boot_stat, 0.975))

```
