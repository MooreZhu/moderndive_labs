## Bert's comments

* `non_parallel_slopes_plot.Rmd`: Example of interaction in ANCOVA is *effing brilliant*. I think I'll include this in moderndive chapter 7!
* `best_practices.Rmd`: Added some minor tweaks (which can be seen [here](https://github.com/rudeboybert/moderndive_labs/pull/5/files?utf8=%E2%9C%93&diff=split&w=1)), mostly just explanations of "why" these are best practices.
