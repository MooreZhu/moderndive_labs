## Bert's Comments/Edits:

* Made any text referring to file names and folder names in `computer font`
* You showed how to run `x <- 6`. What about displaying `x`'s contents?
* Line 217 is a repeat of Line 200 "It is a good idea to try knitting..."
* I'm wondering if the number of exercises is a bit much for the first problem set. But if you think you could manage, then we're good!
* In Close (and open) R Markdown, weren't you thinking of changing the RStudio settings to never save the workspace?
* I'm thinking to take the pressure off new R users, we don't make this PS count for the grade. We can simply use this to guage at what level of comfort they are with R/following such instructions. We could also post the solutions and say "If your work doesn't look like this, don't worry, but please speak to Albert or Jenny ASAP"
