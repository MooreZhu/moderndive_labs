## Bert's Comments/Edits:

* Made any text referring to file names and folder names in `computer font`
* You showed how to run `x <- 6`. What about displaying `x`'s contents?
* Line 217 is a repeat of Line 200 "It is a good idea to try knitting..."
* I'm wondering if the number of exercises is a bit much for the first problem set. But if you think you could manage, then we're good!
* In Close (and open) R Markdown, weren't you thinking of changing the RStudio settings to never save the workspace?
* I'm thinking to take the pressure off new R users, we don't make this PS count for the grade. We can simply use this to guage at what level of comfort they are with R/following such instructions. We could also post the solutions and say "If your work doesn't look like this, don't worry, but please speak to Albert or Jenny ASAP"

## Jenny's Comments/Edits

* Computer font: good...will be sure to do the same in the future
* Showed how to print a value/object later in lab. You can add that in here too if you like
* Repeat of "It is a good ide to try knitting was on purpose...to get them to remember to knit often". If it seems too redundant, please feel free to remove.
* I got rid of the how to open and close R Studio properly part....one less Exercise. That made me a bit nervous anyway....if a student did not follow the instructions they could lose all their work. I can run through how to open and close a file first thing in the second lab section. Feel free to remove more if you like. I suspect some of them (new R users) will  need to work on it outside of lab time. People with some experience...it will be a good, quick review. 
* I am going to show the students before the lab how to change the RStudio settings to never save the workspace. My thought was to also give this reminder in text, because a few of them may not get the settings right, and because it is just a good thing to know. Feel free to delete if you think it is too much. 
* I am definitely posting the solutions for my PSY201 group, and encouraging them to come into office hours to go over anything they got wrong and do not undertand after reading the solutions. 

### Edits

* Added space before at top... you said they don't open right after posting on the course website without this, right?  
* Added a little `toydata.csv` to folder (something they can practice uploading. Change as you see fit
* Changed wording to problem set instead of lab throughout...just to be consistent with rest of the course. And changed the file naming to `PS01_lastname_firstname`, as this is what you had them do throughout. Might as well use consistent terms and expectations throughout.

* All the above sounds good! I like the part about repeating the "Knit early, knit often".
* We'll talk about how to get this posted on the 220 webpage the next time we meet!
