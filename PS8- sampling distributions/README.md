`sampling_dist_demo.Rmd`. Absolutely brilliant. Yes, please hit them with this plot hard on Tue 4/2 Lab09 after they've turned in their work for PS08. I'd say this is even worth printing out in color copies and having them hand-draw 95% confidence intervals and standard errors on, in true "chalk talk"/"draw by hand" style. In other words, reinforce the

that **everyone** in the history of all-time-ever intro stats courses struggle with! 

My only comments are:

* Perhaps mark the population proportion p with a different color than grey so that it really pops?
* I refined the x-axis tick marks to a finer grid; feel free to revert if this doesn't suit you.
* I changed the color palette to a ["color blind safe"](http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=qualitative&scheme=Set2&n=3) one `scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2")` in case you do opt for the printed handouts.
