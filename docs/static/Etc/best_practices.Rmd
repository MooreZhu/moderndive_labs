# Save your work! 

When you can see this little blue disk icon, and your file tab is in red, you have work that is not saved!!

![](save_me_already.png)

Click the little blue disk save icon to save your work. This way if something goes wrong with your computer, you won't lose hours of work!

# Knit early, knit often!! 

By making small incremental changes and knitting often, if a bug i.e. an "error" creeps into your code, you'll be able to isolate where it is easier! Note that knitting also performs a save automatically!

# Put white spaces between code chunks!

While the computer doesn't care if your code is easy to read, humans do! Careful use of formatting tricks like using blank spaces between code chunks can go a long way to make your code easier to read. Be emphathetic to potential collaborators who might read this code! Including your [most important collaborator of all!!!](https://rmhogervorst.nl/cleancode/blog/2016/05/26/content/post/2016-05-26-your-most-valuable-collaborator-future-you/){target="_blank"}

# Only a little bit of code per chunk!!

Don't be afraid to break up your code into several chunks. For example, create one code chunk per rough task. 

### Or this will be you looking for your errors in a haystack of code.

# Put files into folders
