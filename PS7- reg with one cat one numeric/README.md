# Bert's Comments/Edits:

* Could you include the original data + data wrangling code that created your bit.ly csv file for Q9 in the new `PS06/PS06_data_wrangling.R` file? This way I can reproduce it later on if need be.
* See Formatting comments from PS05 [`README.md`](https://github.com/rudeboybert/moderndive_labs/tree/master/PS5-%20regression%20with%20one%20cat%20x#berts-commentsedits).
* **Independent analysis**:
    + Love it!!
    + Q10: Please add labels to plot
* Overall: At first glance, this looks great! I don't imagine much changes to the overall content/structure. However, I'd like to only drill down on comments/edits after you've updated the formatting. I'll make a second pass over this after you've done so. 
* The first side-by-side comparison of before/after of code can be found [here](https://github.com/rudeboybert/moderndive_labs/pull/7/files?utf8=%E2%9C%93&diff=split&w=1)
