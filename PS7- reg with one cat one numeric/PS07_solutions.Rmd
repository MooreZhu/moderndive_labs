## Background {-}

We will again use the hate crimes data we used in Problem Set 05. The FiveThirtyEight article article about those data are in the Jan 23, 2017 ["Higher Rates Of Hate Crimes Are Tied To Income Inequality"](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/higher-rates-of-hate-crimes-are-tied-to-income-inequality/). This week, we will use these data  to run regression models with a single categorical predictor (explanatory) variable **and** a single numeric predictor (explanatory) variable. 

Remember you can knit this file to see the instructions. You can type your answers again right into this file, knit the final draft with all your answers. Please submit the `html` file on Moodle. 

## Setup

First load the necessary packages 

```{r message = F}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(moderndive)
library(readr)
```

Copy paste and run the following in a code chunk to read in the data: 

```{r}
hate_crimes <- read_csv("http://bit.ly/2ItxYg3")
```

Next let's explore the `hate_crimes` data set using the `glimpse()` function from the `dplyr` package:

```{r eval = F}
glimpse(hate_crimes)
```

You should also take a look at the data in the **data viewer**.  

<br> 

Each case/row in these data is a state in the US. This week we will consider the response variable `income`, which is the numeric variable of median income of households in each state. 

We will use

* A categorical explanatory variable `urbanization`: level of urbanization in a region
* A numerical explanatory variable `share_pop_hs`: the percentage of adults 25 and older with a high school degree 

*** 

## Income, education and urbanization 

We will start by modeling the relationship between:

* $y$: Median household income in 2016
* $x_1$: numerical variable percent of adults 25 and older with a high-school degree, contained in the `hs` variable  
* $x_2$: categorical variable level of urbanization in a state: `low`,  or `high`, as
contained in the variable `urbanization`

***

# Exploratory data analysis

We will start by creating a scatterplot showing: 

* Median household `income` on the $y$ axis
* Percent of adults 25 or older with a high school degree on the $x$ axis
* The points colored by the variable `urbanization`
* A line of best fit (regression line) for each level of the variable `urbanization` (one for "low", one for "high")


```{r}
ggplot(data = hate_crimes, aes(y = income, x = hs, color = urbanization)) +
  geom_point()+ 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) + 
  labs(
    x = "Percent of adults with high-school degree", 
    y = "Median household income in USD $", 
    title = "Education and income in states with differing levels of urbanization")
```

***

# Question 1.A

Do you think the relationship between `hs` and `income` is strong or weak, linear or non-linear?

**Answer:** Fairly strong, linear relationship 

# Question 1.B

Which regression line (high `urbanization` or low `urbanization`) appears to have the larger intercept?

**Answer:** high urbanization

***

# Question 2.A 

Does the slope look fairly similar (parallel) for the two levels of urbanization?

**Answer:** Yes

# Question 2.B

Based on the data visualization above, and your answer to Question 2.A, do you think it would be best to run a "parallel slopes" model (i.e. a model that estimates one shared slope for the two levels of urbanization), or a more complex "interaction model" (i.e. a model that estimates a separate slope for the two levels of urbanization)?

**Answer: I personally do not think an interaction model is warranted.**


***

# Question 3

Create a data visualization comparing median household income at "low" and "high" levels of urbanization (you do not need to include the `hs` variable in this plot). Please include axis labels and and title. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = hate_crimes, aes(x = urbanization, y = income)) + 
  geom_boxplot(fill = c("sienna", "darkgreen")) + 
  labs(x = "Level of urbanization in a state", y = "Median household income in USD $", 
       title = "Household income across an urbanization gradient in 2016")
```

***

# Question 4

Run a linear regression model that examines the relationship between household `income` (as response variable), and high-school education, and `urbanization` as explanatory variables. Generate the regression table using the `get_regression_table()` function from the `moderndive` package. 

```{r}
med_income_model <- lm(income ~ hs + urbanization, data = hate_crimes)
get_regression_table(med_income_model)
```


***

# Question 5.A

Is the intercept the same for the states with a "low" and "high" level of urbanization? Is the slope the same? (look at the data visualization above to help with this!) 

**Answers:** Slope is the same, intercept is not. 

# Question 5.B

What is the slope for the regression line of the states with a "high" level of urbanization? What is the intercept?

**Answers:** Slope is 1986.794 (rounded is OK), Intercept is -113725.193

# Question 5.C

What is the slope for the regression line of the states with a "low" level of urbanization? What is the intercept?

**Answers:** Slope is 1986.794 (rounded is OK), Intercept is -113725.193 + -7333.326 = -121058.5

```{r}
-113725.193+ -7333.326
```

# Question 5.D

Based on your regression table output (and the data visualizations), is median household income greater in states that have lower or higher levels of urbanization? By how much?

**Answer:** Median household income is **$7333 greater** in states with high levels of urbanization 

# Question 5.E

For every increase in 1 percentage point of high-school educated adults, what is the associated increase in the median household income of a state?

**Answer:** The associated increase is the slope: $1986


*** 

# Question 6

The regression equation for this model is the following (knit it to look at output!)


$$
\widehat{y} = -113725 + 1986 \times hs  + -7333 \times 1_{\mbox{low urbanization}}(x)
$$


Solve the regression equation for a US state in which `urbanization` is "high"

**Answer:**

$$
\begin{aligned} 
\widehat{y} &= -113725 + 1986 \times hs  + -7333 \times 0 \\
\widehat{y} &= -113725 + 1986 \times hs + 0\\
\end{aligned} 
$$


**Note to grader: 1) fancy formatting not required here. 2) A bunch of the students were unclear about the question here, and picked a value to plug in for HS. I told them this is fine....so...as long as they understood to plug in 0 for low urbanization, that is fine. I saw a number of students in lab interpret this as choose a state with high urbanization, then find its hs value, then plug that into the equation. For next year, change the word "solve" to simplify**

***

# Question 7

What would you predict as the median household income for a state with a **high** level of urbanization, in which 85% of the share of adults have a high school degree?

**Answer:** Note to grader...the values can be very different depending on if the student rounds or does not round the coefficients. 

```{r}
# urbanization high - if they round
-113725 + (1986* 85) + (-7333 * 0)
```


```{r}
# urbanization high - if they don't round
-113725.193	 + (1986.794 * 85) + (-7333.326 * 0)
```

***

# Question 8

What would you predict as the median household income for a state with a **low** level of urbanization, in which 85% of the share of adults have a high school degree?

**Answer:** Note to grader...the values can be very different depending on if the student rounds or does not round the coefficients. 

```{r}
# urbanization high - if they round
-113725 + (1986* 85) + (-7333 * 1)
```


```{r}
# urbanization high - if they don't round
-113725.193	 + (1986.794 * 85) + (-7333.326 * 1)
```

***

# Question 9

What would you predict as the median household income for a state with a **low** level of urbanization, in which 30%  of adults have a high school degree?

**Answer:** I wouldn't make that prediction. The lowest percentage in our data set was ~ 70, so extrapolating like this would not be a good idea.

***

# Question 10

What was the observed `income` value for Maine (row 2)? What was the prediction for Maine according to our model? What is the residual? Did our model over or underestimate the median income for this state? 

**Answer:** 

observed: 51710

predicted: 57752.93

this was an over prediction 

the residual was -6042.926

## Independent analysis 

![](https://ptes.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/water-vole-credit-Iain-Green-www.wildwonder.co_.uk-2_cropped.jpg){width=50%}

<br> 

You will now use the tools you have learned, and a new data set to solve a conservation problem.  

Wildlife biologists are interested in managing/protecting habitats for a declining species of vole, but are not sure about what habitats it prefers. Two things that biologists can easily control with management is percent cover of vegetation, and where habitat improvements occur (i.e. is it important to create/protect habitat in moist or dry sites, etc). To help inform habitat management of this vole species, the researchers in this study counted the number of `voles` at 56 random study sites. At each site, they measured percent cover of  `veg`etation, and recorded whether a site had moist or dry `soil`. 

The data can be read in like so

```{r}
vole_trapping <- read_csv("http://bit.ly/2IgDF0E")
```

The data contains the variables: 

* `site` for the id of each random study site (each case or row is a survey/trapping site)
* `voles` for the vole count at each site
* `veg` for the percent cover of vegetation at each site
* `soil` identifying a site as "moist" or "dry"

Generate a regression model with `voles` as the response variable `y` and `veg` and `soil` as explanatory variables. Use the results of the model to answer the following questions **based on the available data**. A data visualization will probably also help you: 

**Note to grader. They do not need to make this exact plot...the point is just that they realize to use regression to answer an applied question, and do not just use their opinion on the matter to answer**

```{r include = F}
ggplot(data = vole_trapping, aes(x = veg, y = voles, color = soil)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F) + 
  labs(title = "Vole abundance across a soil moiture and 
       vegetation density gradient", x = "percent cover of vegetation", 
       y = "Vole abundance")
```

```{r include = F}
mod <- lm(voles ~ soil + veg, data = vole_trapping)
get_regression_table(mod)
```


***

# Question 11

Would you recommend to a manager that they try to protect sites with high or low vegetation cover? Why?

**Answer:** high vegetation cover...greater vegetation cover is associated with more moles 

***

# Question 12 

Dry sites are typically a lot less money to purchase and maintain for conservation organizations. Thus, if a conservation organization decides to purchase a few dry sites, roughly what percent cover of vegetation do they need to maintain on these sites (at a minimum) to support a population of about 30 voles at the site? 

**Answer** Eyeballing it from the graph, ~ 55% **[Note to grader...they can solve this other ways too...so long as they get something in this range through looking at the data, they should recieve credit. ]**

***

# Question 13

The Nature Conservancy is looking at purchasing a site for this species (in the same study area) that has moist soil and 40% vegetation cover. **Using the regression equation** what would you predict as the possible vole population the site might be able to support?

```{r}
15.46 + (0.259 * 40) + (9.1 *1)
```


**Answer:** 34 or 35 critters
